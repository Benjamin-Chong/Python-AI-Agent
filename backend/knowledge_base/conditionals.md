# Conditionals
- conditionals are super useful for comparing two things for logic

## if statement
- Declaration:
```python
if your_condition:
    x += 5 #this code will execute if true
```
- all if statement types can use the conditional operators like >, <, >=, <=
## if else
- Declaration:
```python
if your_condition:
    x += 5 #this code will execute if true
else:
    x -= 5 #this code block will execute if false
```
## if else if else
```python
if your_condition:
    x += 5 #this code will execute if true
elif another_condition:
    x += 2 #this will execute if the first condition is false and the second condition is true
else:
    x -= 5 #this code block will execute if false
```

# and / or
- if statements can use and / or to further modify their conditions
- and: both conditions must be true to return true.
- or: only one condition must true to return true.
