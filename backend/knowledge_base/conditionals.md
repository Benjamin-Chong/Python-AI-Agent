# Conditionals
- Conditionals are super useful for comparing two things based on logical comparisons

## If Statement
```python
if your_condition:
    x += 5 #this code will execute if true
```
- All if statement types can use the conditional operators like >, <, >=, <=

## If Else
```python
if your_condition:
    x += 5 #this code will execute if true
else:
    x -= 5 #this code block will execute if false
```

## If Else If Else
```python
if your_condition:
    x += 5 #this code will execute if true
elif another_condition:
    x += 2 #this will execute if the first condition is false and the second condition is true
else:
    x -= 5 #this code block will execute if false
```

# And / Or
- If statements can use and / or to further modify their conditions
- And: both conditions must be true to return true.
- Or: at least one condition must true to return true.
