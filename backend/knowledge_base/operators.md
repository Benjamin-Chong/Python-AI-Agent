# Operators
- Operators allow Python to perform mathematical calculations, such as adding and subtracting

## Types of Operators
- There are many types of operators. 
- There are assignment operators, arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.

### Assignment Operators
- These operators are meant to assign something to a variable. Example: `x = 5`
- =

### Mathematical Assignment Operators
- Used to update a variable by applying an operation to its current value

- += (add and assign)
- -= (subtract and assign)
- *= (multiply and assign)
- /= (divide and assign)
- %= (modulus and assign — remainder only)
- //= (floor divide and assign — no decimal)
- **= (exponentiate and assign)
- &= (bitwise AND and assign)
- |= (bitwise OR and assign)
- ^= (bitwise XOR and assign)
- >>= (bitwise right shift and assign)
- <<= (bitwise left shift and assign)

### Arithmetic Operators
- + (addition)
- - (subtraction)
- * (multiplication)
- / (division)
- % (modulus)
- ** (exponentiation)
- // (floor division)

### Comparison Operators
- == (equal to)
- != (not equal to)
- > (greater than)
- < (less than)
- >= (greater than or equal to)
- <= (less than or equal to)

### Logical Operators
- And: both statements need to be true to return true
- Or: only one statement needs to be true to return true
- Not: returns the opposite of the result
