# Operators
Operators allow Python to perform mathematical calculations such as adding and subtracting

## Types of Operators
- there are many types of operators. There are assignment operators, arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.

### Assignment Operators
- these operators are meant to assign something to a variable. An example is x = 5.
- =
### Mathematical Assignment Operators
- +=
- -=
- *=
- /=
- %=: mod operator. only remainder
- //=: floor operator. no decimal
- &=
- |=
- ^=
- >>=
- <<=

### Arithmetic Operators
- + (addition)
- - (subtraction)
- * (multiplication)
- / (division)
- % (modulus)
- ** (exponentiation)
- // (floor division)

### Comparison Operators
- == (equal to)
- != (not equal to)
- > (greater than)
- < (less than)
- >= (greater than or equal to)
- <= (less than or equal to)

### Logical Operators
- and: both statements need to be true to return true
- or: only one statement needs to be true to return true
- not: returns the opposite of the result
