# Loops
- Loops are fundamental for solving repetitive problems
- Two types of loops: for and while loop

## For Loop
- Can iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, etc)

### Declaration
- for __ in __:
- The first item is the iterator and the second part is the sequence

## While Loop
- Iterates while a condition is true and stops once it is false

### Declaration
- while your_condition:

## Break
- `break` stops the loop before it is complete

## Continue
- `continue` skips the current iteration and moves onto the next iteration

## Range function
- Used to create a list of numbers
- Commonly used with for loops
- Syntax: range(start, end, step_sequence) #does not include the final number

## For else
- When the for loop ends, the else statement will execute if no `break` is encountered

## Pass
- `pass` is used as a way to act as a placeholder to prevent errors when writing loops.
