# Loops
- these are fundamental for solving problems.
- repetitve things can be solved using a loop.
- two types of loops: for and while loop

## For loop
- can iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, etc)

### Declation
- for __ in __:
- the first item is the iterator and the second part is the sequence.

## While loop
- iterates while a condition is true and stops once it is false.

### Declaration
- while your_condition:

## Break
- break stops the loop before it is complete

## Continue
- skips the current iteration and moves onto the next iteration

## Range function
- used to create a list of numbers
- syntax: range(start, end, step_sequence) #does not include the final number

## For else
- when the for loop ends, the else statement will execute

## Pass
- pass is used as a way to act as a placeholder to prevent errors when writing loops.
